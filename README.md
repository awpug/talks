What is this?
=============
This repo is [AWPUG](http://www.meetup.com/austinwebpythonusergroup/)'s way of keeping sponsorships and meetups organized. If you want to get involved, fork this repo and issue a pull request.

We especially need people to sign up to be release managers beyond the next few months.

Sponsoring
==========

What is sponsoring?
-------------------
Sponsorship is paying for food and beverages or any portion thereof. In return, you get in the heads and hearts of Austin's web developer community. It's usually $300-$400, depending on what type of food (tacos are more expensive than pizza, for instance). You can be as involved as you'd like: all the way from organizing everything, including sending out the announcements, to just handing us a check. We also tend to give our sponsors first dibs on giving a presentation.

We typically have between 30-60 attendees. Of course, you're welcome to come to the meetings and announce you're hiring no matter if you sponsor or not. The community looks at sponsorship as a way to ensure we continue to foster an awesome community, not necessarily as a way to pay for pimping your jobs.
